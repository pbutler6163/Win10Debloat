# Win10Debloat
Win10Debloat is a simple powershell script that allows you to remove most pre-installed windows 10 apps, disable bing in windows search, disable tips and suggestions across the OS (such as the lockscreen, startmenu and settings) and declutter the windows explorer by hiding certain folders (such as 3D objects) from the sidebar aswell as disabling certain context menu options that a regular user would (almost) never use.

You can pick and choose which modifications you want the script to make, but the default settings should be fine for most people. All of the changes can be reverted using the registry files that are included in the 'Regfiles' folder, and all of the apps that are removed by default can easily be reinstalled from the microsoft store.

### By default, the Win10Debloat script will:
- Remove all bloatware apps from [this list](#these-apps-will-be-deleted-by-default).
- Hide the 3D objects folder under 'This pc' in windows explorer.
- Disable bing in windows search.
- Disable tips & tricks on the lockscreen. (This changes your lockscreen wallpaper to the windows default)
- Disable tips, tricks and suggestions in the startmenu and settings.
- Disable the 'Include in library' from context menu.
- Disable the 'Give access to' from context menu.
- Disable the 'Share' from context menu.

## Usage

2. Run the script by right-clicking the 'Run.ps1' file and selecting 'Run with Powershell' option.
3. Accept the windows UAC prompt to run the script as administrator, this is required for the script to function.

### Advanced method:
This method is a bit more complicated, but it allows you to run the script with certain arguments to customize what the script does, without requiring any user input at runtime.
